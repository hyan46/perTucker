description: We propose personalized Tucker decomposition (perTucker) to address the
  limitations of traditional tensor decomposition methods in capturing heterogeneity
  across different datasets. perTucker decomposes tensor data into shared global components
  and personalized local components. We introduce a mode orthogonality assumption
  and develop a proximal gradient regularized block coordinate descent algorithm that
  is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point. By learning unique and common representations
  across datasets, we demonstrate perTucker's effectiveness in anomaly detection,
  client classification, and clustering through a simulation study and two case studies
  on solar flare detection and tonnage signal classification.
